PROJECT FEATURES
Adaptive Library Search, Issue & Recommendation System
================================================================================

CORE FEATURES
================================================================================

1. ADVANCED SEARCH SYSTEM
   ✓ Prefix-based search on book titles
   ✓ Prefix-based search on author names
   ✓ Case-insensitive queries
   ✓ Ranked results by popularity and borrow frequency
   ✓ Lightning-fast: O(m) independent of dataset size
   ✓ Adaptive ranking: Learns from search history

2. BOOK AVAILABILITY TRACKING
   ✓ Real-time availability display for each book
   ✓ Shows total copies vs available copies
   ✓ Instant updates after issue/return
   ✓ Physical copy tracking (1-4 copies per book)
   ✓ Copy-level details (which copy, who has it, since when)

3. BOOK ISSUE SYSTEM
   ✓ One-click book borrowing
   ✓ User validation (Student/Faculty)
   ✓ Automatic availability decrement
   ✓ Transaction logging for auditing
   ✓ Copy assignment and tracking
   ✓ Issued date/time recording

4. BOOK RETURN SYSTEM
   ✓ One-click book return
   ✓ Automatic availability increment
   ✓ Process reservation queue when book available
   ✓ Transaction logging
   ✓ Copy availability reset

5. PRIORITY-BASED RESERVATION SYSTEM
   ✓ Faculty users get highest priority (Tier 1)
   ✓ Final-year students get second priority (Tier 2)
   ✓ Regular students get third priority (Tier 3)
   ✓ Within same tier: FIFO (first come, first served)
   ✓ Automatic queue management
   ✓ Shows position in queue
   ✓ Fair distribution of limited resources

6. SMART RECOMMENDATIONS
   ✓ Category-based book discovery
   ✓ "Similar books" suggestions
   ✓ Graph-based algorithm (BFS traversal)
   ✓ Ranked by popularity and borrow impact
   ✓ Contextual suggestions (books borrowed together)
   ✓ Depth-2 exploration for diverse recommendations

7. UNDO FUNCTIONALITY
   ✓ Reverse last transaction (issue or return)
   ✓ One-click undo
   ✓ Multiple undo capability (undo up to last N actions)
   ✓ Automatic state restoration
   ✓ History-based implementation

8. DATASET & CONTENT
   ✓ 1000 preloaded books at startup
   ✓ Multiple categories (10+):
     - Programming (C++, Java, Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript)
     - Software Engineering (Design Patterns, Clean Code)
     - Data Structures & Algorithms
     - Cloud & DevOps (Kubernetes, Docker)
     - Machine Learning & AI
     - Web Development
     - Cybersecurity
     - Networking
     - Operating Systems
     - Agile & Project Management
   ✓ Each book has: ISBN, Title, Author, Category, Copy Count
